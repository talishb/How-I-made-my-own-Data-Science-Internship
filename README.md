**How I crafted my own Data Science Internship!**

At the beginning of 2019, I was struggling to find an internship for the summer!
After some serious self-reflection, I committed to learning everything I could about machine learning, data science, and the tech industry. Thus, I decided to construct my very own summer internship to help me fill the gaps in my knowledge and learn more! I built my own curriculum, a hodgepodge of hundreds of websites and forums, and committed between 4â€“6 hours each day.

I went from not having an internship to leading data science for a technology startup. If this post helps atleast 1 person, I would have achieved my objective. 

Flip your script :)
